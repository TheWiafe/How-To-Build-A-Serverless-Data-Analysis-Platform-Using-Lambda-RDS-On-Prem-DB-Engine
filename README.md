## Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle with efficient data analysis while ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness. This project addresses these challenges by creating a serverless data analysis platform that allows Lambda functions to access and process data from both a public RDS database and a private RDS database.

Specifically, this project creates a solution that;

1. Utilizes AWS Lambda functions for data processing.
2. Access data from a public and private RDS database.
3. Access RDS database using On-Prem DB engine.
4. Is implemented within a VPC and subnet architecture.
